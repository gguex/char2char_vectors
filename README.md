# A Framework for Embedding Entities in a Textual Narrative: a Case Study on *Les Misérables*

## Abstract 

In this article, we propose a general and flexible framework in order to study \emph{narrative entities} found in a literary work. This framework is exposed starting from a broad perspective, consisting in how to segment the work into \emph{textual unit} and organize the resulting data, and is narrowed down to a particular case: the study of characters and relationships found in \emph{Les Misérables}. A notable choice was made in the current instance of the framework: the construction of \emph{embeddings} containing both textual units and narrative entities alongside words. These embeddings, where different spatial regions can be interpreted with word vectors, are the keys helping us to characterize studied entities. Four types of embedding methods are constructed, and their results on \emph{Les Misérables} permit to show the potential of this framework in order to analyses characters and relationships in a narrative
