Lead, boy. Which way?
The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach. Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried. Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets. Raise up the Montagues, some others search. We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry. Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.
A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too. Enter the Prince and Attendants.
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain, And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill’d.
Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men’s tombs.
