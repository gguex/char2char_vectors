55	1	1	benvolio	Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sunPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,Where underneath the grove of sycamoreThat westward rooteth from this city side,So early walking did I see your son.Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,And stole into the covert of the wood.I, measuring his affections by my own,Which then most sought where most might not be found,Being one too many by my weary self,Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1
56	1	1	montague	Many a morning hath he there been seen,With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;But all so soon as the all-cheering sunShould in the farthest east begin to drawThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,Away from light steals home my heavy son,And private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight outAnd makes himself an artificial night.Black and portentous must this humour prove,Unless good counsel may the cause remove.	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1

78	1	1	romeo	Why such is love’s transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate to have it prestWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:What is it else? A madness most discreet,A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1

178	1	4	mercutio	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agate-stoneOn the fore-finger of an alderman,Drawn with a team of little atomiesOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,Not half so big as a round little wormPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.And in this state she gallops night by nightThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,Then dreams he of another benefice:Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,Of healths five fathom deep; and then anonDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,And sleeps again. This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the night;And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them, and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage:This is she,—	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

All this utteredWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’dCould not take truce with the unruly spleenOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tiltsWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beatsCold death aside, and with the other sendsIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterityRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,His agile arm beats down their fatal points,And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose armAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the lifeOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.But by and by comes back to Romeo,Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere ICould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Come, civil night,Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,And learn me how to lose a winning match,Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,Think true love acted simple modesty.Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightWhiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with night,And pay no worship to the garish sun.O, I have bought the mansion of a love,But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this dayAs is the night before some festivalTo an impatient child that hath new robesAnd may not wear them.

557	3	14	friar lawrence	Hold thy desperate hand.Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denoteThe unreasonable fury of a beast.Unseemly woman in a seeming man,And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,I thought thy disposition better temper’d.Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,By doing damned hate upon thyself?Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meetIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,And usest none in that true use indeedWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,Digressing from the valour of a man;Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,Misshapen in the conduct of them both,Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,Is set afire by thine own ignorance,And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.A pack of blessings light upon thy back;Happiness courts thee in her best array;But like a misshaped and sullen wench,Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.But look thou stay not till the watch be set,For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;Where thou shalt live till we can find a timeTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee backWith twenty hundred thousand times more joyThan thou went’st forth in lamentation.Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,And bid her hasten all the house to bed,Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.Romeo is coming.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.What if it be a poison, which the FriarSubtly hath minister’d to have me dead,Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,Because he married me before to Romeo?I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,For he hath still been tried a holy man.How if, when I am laid into the tomb,I wake before the time that RomeoCome to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?Or, if I live, is it not very like,The horrible conceit of death and night,Together with the terror of the place,As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,Where for this many hundred years the bonesOf all my buried ancestors are pack’d,Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,At some hours in the night spirits resort—Alack, alack, is it not like that I,So early waking, what with loathsome smells,And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,Environed with all these hideous fears,And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghostSeeking out Romeo that did spit his bodyUpon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

842	5	24	friar lawrence	I will be brief, for my short date of breathIs not so long as is a tedious tale.Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.I married them; and their stol’n marriage dayWas Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely deathBanish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.You, to remove that siege of grief from her,Betroth’d, and would have married her perforceTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,And with wild looks, bid me devise some meansTo rid her from this second marriage,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,A sleeping potion, which so took effectAs I intended, for it wrought on herThe form of death. Meantime I writ to RomeoThat he should hither come as this dire nightTo help to take her from her borrow’d grave,Being the time the potion’s force should cease.But he which bore my letter, Friar John,Was stay’d by accident; and yesternightReturn’d my letter back. Then all aloneAt the prefixed hour of her wakingCame I to take her from her kindred’s vault,Meaning to keep her closely at my cellTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.But when I came, some minute ere the timeOf her awaking, here untimely layThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.She wakes; and I entreated her come forthAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;And she, too desperate, would not go with me,But, as it seems, did violence on herself.All this I know; and to the marriageHer Nurse is privy. And if ought in thisMiscarried by my fault, let my old lifeBe sacrific’d, some hour before his time,Unto the rigour of severest law.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
