0	1	1	BARNARDO	FRANCISCO	Who’s there?
1	1	1	FRANCISCO	BARNARDO	Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
2	1	1	BARNARDO	FRANCISCO	Long live the King!
3	1	1	FRANCISCO	BARNARDO	Barnardo?
4	1	1	BARNARDO	FRANCISCO	He.
5	1	1	FRANCISCO	BARNARDO	You come most carefully upon your hour.
6	1	1	BARNARDO	FRANCISCO	’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
7	1	1	FRANCISCO	BARNARDO	For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.
8	1	1	BARNARDO	FRANCISCO	Have you had quiet guard?
9	1	1	FRANCISCO	BARNARDO	Not a mouse stirring.
10	1	1	BARNARDO	FRANCISCO	Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
11	1	1	FRANCISCO	BARNARDO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
12	1	1	HORATIO	FRANCISCO	Friends to this ground.
13	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	And liegemen to the Dane.
14	1	1	FRANCISCO	MARCELLUS	Give you good night.
15	1	1	MARCELLUS	FRANCISCO	O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev’d you?
16	1	1	FRANCISCO	MARCELLUS	Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.
17	1	1	MARCELLUS	FRANCISCO	Holla, Barnardo!
18	1	1	BARNARDO	MARCELLUS	Say, what, is Horatio there?
19	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	A piece of him.
20	1	1	BARNARDO	HORATIO	Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
21	1	1	MARCELLUS	BARNARDO	What, has this thing appear’d again tonight?
22	1	1	BARNARDO	MARCELLUS	I have seen nothing.
23	1	1	MARCELLUS	BARNARDO	Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us. Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
24	1	1	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.
25	1	1	BARNARDO	HORATIO	Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.
26	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
27	1	1	BARNARDO	HORATIO	Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from the pole, Had made his course t’illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one—
28	1	1	MARCELLUS	BARNARDO	Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again. Enter Ghost.
29	1	1	BARNARDO	MARCELLUS	In the same figure, like the King that’s dead.
30	1	1	MARCELLUS	BARNARDO	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
31	1	1	BARNARDO	MARCELLUS	Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
32	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder. BARNARDO It would be spoke to.
33	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Question it, Horatio.
34	1	1	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	What art thou that usurp’st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.
35	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	It is offended.
36	1	1	BARNARDO	MARCELLUS	See, it stalks away.
37	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
38	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	’Tis gone, and will not answer.
39	1	1	BARNARDO	MARCELLUS	How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale. Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on’t?
40	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.
41	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Is it not like the King?
42	1	1	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he th’ambitious Norway combated; So frown’d he once, when in an angry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. ’Tis strange.
43	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
44	1	1	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	In what particular thought to work I know not; But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
45	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is’t that can inform me?
46	1	1	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King, Whose image even but now appear’d to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride, Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet, For so this side of our known world esteem’d him, Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror; Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our King; which had return’d To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov’nant And carriage of the article design’d, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle, hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost. And this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.
47	1	1	BARNARDO	HORATIO	I think it be no other but e’en so: Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.
48	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands, Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen. Re-enter Ghost. But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again! I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and grace to me, Speak to me. If thou art privy to thy country’s fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it. Stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus!
49	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
50	1	1	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	Do, if it will not stand.
51	1	1	BARNARDO	HORATIO	’Tis here!
52	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	’Tis here!
53	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	’Tis gone! We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence, For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.
54	1	1	BARNARDO	MARCELLUS	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
55	1	1	HORATIO	BARNARDO	And then it started, like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th’extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine. And of the truth herein This present object made probation.
56	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm; So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.
57	1	1	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	So have I heard, and do in part believe it. But look, the morn in russet mantle clad, Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill. Break we our watch up, and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
58	1	1	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Let’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently.
59	1	2	KING	VOLTEMAND	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe; Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th’imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy, With one auspicious and one dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail’d to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway, Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow. Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty. CORNELIUS and
60	1	2	VOLTEMAND	KING	In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
61	1	2	KING	VOLTEMAND	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you? You told us of some suit. What is’t, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
62	1	2	LAERTES	KING	Dread my lord, Your leave and favour to return to France, From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation; Yet now I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France, And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
63	1	2	KING	LAERTES	Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?
64	1	2	POLONIUS	KING	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition; and at last Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent. I do beseech you give him leave to go.
65	1	2	KING	POLONIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—
66	1	2	HAMLET	KING	A little more than kin, and less than kind.
67	1	2	KING	HAMLET	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
68	1	2	HAMLET	KING	Not so, my lord, I am too much i’ the sun.
69	1	2	QUEEN	HAMLET	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust. Thou know’st ’tis common, all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.
70	1	2	HAMLET	QUEEN	Ay, madam, it is common.
71	1	2	QUEEN	HAMLET	If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?
72	1	2	HAMLET	QUEEN	Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems. ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief, That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
73	1	2	KING	HAMLET	’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father, That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation, for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief, It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool’d; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died today, ‘This must be so.’ We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
74	1	2	QUEEN	KING	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
75	1	2	HAMLET	QUEEN	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
76	1	2	KING	HAMLET	Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks today But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
77	1	2	HAMLET	KING	O that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d His canon ’gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on’t! Oh fie! ’tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother, That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month— Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman! A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father’s body Like Niobe, all tears.—Why she, even she— O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn’d longer,—married with mine uncle, My father’s brother; but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month? Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue. Enter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.
78	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Hail to your lordship!
79	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget myself.
80	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	The same, my lord, And your poor servant ever.
81	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?— Marcellus?
82	1	2	MARCELLUS	HAMLET	My good lord.
83	1	2	HAMLET	MARCELLUS	I am very glad to see you.—Good even, sir.— But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
84	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	A truant disposition, good my lord.
85	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do my ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself. I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
86	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
87	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student. I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.
88	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.
89	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak’d meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio. My father,—methinks I see my father.
90	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Where, my lord?
91	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
92	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
93	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.
94	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
95	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Saw? Who?
96	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	My lord, the King your father.
97	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	The King my father!
98	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you.
99	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	For God’s love let me hear.
100	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch, Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father; These hands are not more like.
101	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	But where was this?
102	1	2	MARCELLUS	HAMLET	My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
103	1	2	HAMLET	MARCELLUS	Did you not speak to it?
104	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up it head, and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak. But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanish’d from our sight.
105	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	’Tis very strange.
106	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
107	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch tonight? Mar. and
108	1	2	BARNARDO	HAMLET	We do, my lord.
109	1	2	HAMLET	BARNARDO	Arm’d, say you? Both. Arm’d, my lord.
110	1	2	HAMLET	BARNARDO	From top to toe?
111	1	2	BOTH	HAMLET	My lord, from head to foot.
112	1	2	HAMLET	BOTH	Then saw you not his face?
113	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.
114	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	What, look’d he frowningly?
115	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
116	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Pale, or red?
117	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Nay, very pale.
118	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	And fix’d his eyes upon you?
119	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Most constantly.
120	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	I would I had been there.
121	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	It would have much amaz’d you.
122	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?
123	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. MARCELLUS and
124	1	2	BARNARDO	HORATIO	Longer, longer.
125	1	2	HORATIO	BARNARDO	Not when I saw’t.
126	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	His beard was grizzled, no?
127	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver’d.
128	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	I will watch tonight; Perchance ’twill walk again.
129	1	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	I warrant you it will.
130	1	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue. I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well. Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.
131	1	2	ALL	HAMLET	Our duty to your honour.
132	1	2	HAMLET	ALL	Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. My father’s spirit in arms! All is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.
133	1	3	LAERTES	OPHELIA	My necessaries are embark’d. Farewell. And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.
134	1	3	OPHELIA	LAERTES	Do you doubt that?
135	1	3	LAERTES	OPHELIA	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
136	1	3	OPHELIA	LAERTES	No more but so?
137	1	3	LAERTES	OPHELIA	Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalu’d persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmaster’d importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister; And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos’d, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then, best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
138	1	3	OPHELIA	LAERTES	I shall th’effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart. But good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whilst like a puff’d and reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede.
139	1	3	LAERTES	OPHELIA	O, fear me not. I stay too long. But here my father comes. Enter Polonius. A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
140	1	3	POLONIUS	LAERTES	Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame. The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay’d for. There, my blessing with you. And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion’d thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice: Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy: For the apparel oft proclaims the man; And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be: For loan oft loses both itself and friend; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.
141	1	3	LAERTES	POLONIUS	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
142	1	3	POLONIUS	LAERTES	The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
143	1	3	LAERTES	POLONIUS	Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.
144	1	3	OPHELIA	LAERTES	’Tis in my memory lock’d, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
145	1	3	LAERTES	OPHELIA	Farewell.
146	1	3	POLONIUS	LAERTES	What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
147	1	3	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
148	1	3	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Marry, well bethought: ’Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so,—as so ’tis put on me, And that in way of caution,—I must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? Give me up the truth.
149	1	3	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.
150	1	3	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
151	1	3	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
152	1	3	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Marry, I’ll teach you; think yourself a baby; That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or,—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Roaming it thus,—you’ll tender me a fool.
153	1	3	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	My lord, he hath importun’d me with love In honourable fashion.
154	1	3	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
155	1	3	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
156	1	3	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him that he is young; And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all. I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to’t, I charge you; come your ways.
157	1	3	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	I shall obey, my lord.
158	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
159	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	It is a nipping and an eager air.
160	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	What hour now?
161	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	I think it lacks of twelve.
162	1	4	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	No, it is struck.
163	1	4	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. What does this mean, my lord?
164	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels; And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.
165	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	Is it a custom?
166	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	Ay marry is’t; And to my mind, though I am native here, And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour’d in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform’d at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin, By their o’ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason; Or by some habit, that too much o’erleavens The form of plausive manners;—that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being Nature’s livery or Fortune’s star,— His virtues else,—be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo, Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance often doubt To his own scandal.
167	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	Look, my lord, it comes! Enter Ghost.
168	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou com’st in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d, Hath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again! What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?
169	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.
170	1	4	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground. But do not go with it.
171	1	4	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	No, by no means.
172	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	It will not speak; then will I follow it.
173	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	Do not, my lord.
174	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin’s fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.
175	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o’er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason, And draw you into madness? Think of it. The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.
176	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	It waves me still. Go on, I’ll follow thee.
177	1	4	MARCELLUS	HAMLET	You shall not go, my lord.
178	1	4	HAMLET	MARCELLUS	Hold off your hands.
179	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	Be rul’d; you shall not go.
180	1	4	HAMLET	HORATIO	My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve. Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me. I say, away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.
181	1	4	HORATIO	HAMLET	He waxes desperate with imagination.
182	1	4	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.
183	1	4	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	Have after. To what issue will this come?
184	1	4	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
185	1	4	HORATIO	MARCELLUS	Heaven will direct it.
186	1	4	MARCELLUS	HORATIO	Nay, let’s follow him.
187	1	5	MARCELLUS	HAMLET	Nor I, my lord, in faith.
188	1	5	HAMLET	MARCELLUS	Upon my sword.
189	1	5	MARCELLUS	HAMLET	We have sworn, my lord, already.
190	1	5	HAMLET	MARCELLUS	Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
191	1	5	GHOST	HAMLET	Swear.
192	1	5	HAMLET	GHOST	Ha, ha boy, say’st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny? Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage. Consent to swear.
193	1	5	HORATIO	HAMLET	Propose the oath, my lord.
194	1	5	HAMLET	HORATIO	Never to speak of this that you have seen. Swear by my sword.
195	1	5	GHOST	HAMLET	Swear.
196	1	5	HAMLET	GHOST	_Hic et ubique?_ Then we’ll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword. Never to speak of this that you have heard. Swear by my sword.
197	1	5	GHOST	HAMLET	Swear.
198	1	5	HAMLET	GHOST	Well said, old mole! Canst work i’ th’earth so fast? A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
199	1	5	HORATIO	HAMLET	O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.
200	1	5	HAMLET	HORATIO	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come, Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself,— As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on— That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber’d thus, or this head-shake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As ‘Well, we know’, or ‘We could and if we would’, Or ‘If we list to speak’; or ‘There be and if they might’, Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me:—this not to do. So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
201	1	5	GHOST	HAMLET	Swear.
202	1	5	HAMLET	GHOST	Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you; And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do t’express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together, And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint. O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right. Nay, come, let’s go together.
203	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
204	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	I will, my lord.
205	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquiry Of his behaviour.
206	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	My lord, I did intend it.
207	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question, That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him, As thus, ‘I know his father and his friends, And in part him’—do you mark this, Reynaldo?
208	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	Ay, very well, my lord.
209	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	‘And in part him, but,’ you may say, ‘not well; But if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild; Addicted so and so;’ and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty.
210	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	As gaming, my lord?
211	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarrelling, drabbing. You may go so far.
212	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	My lord, that would dishonour him.
213	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Faith no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty; The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.
214	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	But my good lord—
215	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Wherefore should you do this?
216	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	Ay, my lord, I would know that.
217	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Marry, sir, here’s my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of warrant. You laying these slight sullies on my son, As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ th’ working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur’d He closes with you in this consequence; ‘Good sir,’ or so; or ‘friend,’ or ‘gentleman’— According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country.
218	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	Very good, my lord.
219	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	And then, sir, does he this,— He does—What was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?
220	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	At ‘closes in the consequence.’ At ‘friend or so,’ and ‘gentleman.’
221	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	At ‘closes in the consequence’ ay, marry! He closes with you thus: ‘I know the gentleman, I saw him yesterday, or t’other day, Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say, There was he gaming, there o’ertook in’s rouse, There falling out at tennis’: or perchance, ‘I saw him enter such a house of sale’— _Videlicet_, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses, and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out. So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
222	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	My lord, I have.
223	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	God b’ wi’ you, fare you well.
224	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	Good my lord.
225	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Observe his inclination in yourself.
226	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	I shall, my lord.
227	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	And let him ply his music.
228	2	1	REYNALDO	POLONIUS	Well, my lord.
229	2	1	POLONIUS	REYNALDO	Farewell. Enter Ophelia. How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?
230	2	1	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.
231	2	1	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	With what, in the name of God?
232	2	1	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d, No hat upon his head, his stockings foul’d, Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle, Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.
233	2	1	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Mad for thy love?
234	2	1	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.
235	2	1	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	What said he?
236	2	1	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And with his other hand thus o’er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so, At last,—a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets me go, And with his head over his shoulder turn’d He seem’d to find his way without his eyes, For out o’ doors he went without their help, And to the last bended their light on me.
237	2	1	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Come, go with me. I will go seek the King. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself, And leads the will to desperate undertakings, As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,— What, have you given him any hard words of late?
238	2	1	OPHELIA	POLONIUS	No, my good lord; but as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.
239	2	1	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him. I fear’d he did but trifle, And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy! It seems it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. This must be known, which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
240	2	2	KING	QUEEN	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s transformation; so I call it, Since nor th’exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him So much from th’understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreat you both That, being of so young days brought up with him, And since so neighbour’d to his youth and humour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time, so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That, open’d, lies within our remedy.
241	2	2	QUEEN	KING	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you, And sure I am, two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king’s remembrance.
242	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	QUEEN	Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.
243	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	ROSENCRANTZ	We both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded.
244	2	2	KING	GUILDENSTERN	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
245	2	2	QUEEN	KING	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz. And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
246	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	QUEEN	Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him.
247	2	2	QUEEN	GUILDENSTERN	Ay, amen. Enter Polonius.
248	2	2	POLONIUS	QUEEN	Th’ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return’d.
249	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
250	2	2	POLONIUS	KING	Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious King: And I do think,—or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath us’d to do—that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.
251	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	O speak of that, that do I long to hear.
252	2	2	POLONIUS	KING	Give first admittance to th’ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
253	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
254	2	2	QUEEN	KING	I doubt it is no other but the main, His father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage.
255	2	2	KING	QUEEN	Well, we shall sift him. Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius. Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
256	2	2	VOLTEMAND	KING	Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew’s levies, which to him appear’d To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack; But better look’d into, he truly found It was against your Highness; whereat griev’d, That so his sickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke from Norway; and in fine, Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th’assay of arms against your Majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, herein further shown, That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.
257	2	2	KING	VOLTEMAND	It likes us well; And at our more consider’d time we’ll read, Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour. Go to your rest, at night we’ll feast together:. Most welcome home.
258	2	2	POLONIUS	KING	This business is well ended. My liege and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time. Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief. Your noble son is mad. Mad call I it; for to define true madness, What is’t but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go.
259	2	2	QUEEN	POLONIUS	More matter, with less art.
260	2	2	POLONIUS	QUEEN	Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity; And pity ’tis ’tis true. A foolish figure, But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him then. And now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause. Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend, I have a daughter—have whilst she is mine— Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise. _To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia_— That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; ‘beautified’ is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. _these; in her excellent white bosom, these, &c._
261	2	2	QUEEN	POLONIUS	Came this from Hamlet to her?
262	2	2	POLONIUS	QUEEN	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. _Doubt thou the stars are fire, Doubt that the sun doth move, Doubt truth to be a liar, But never doubt I love. O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon my groans. But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu. Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
263	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	_ This in obedience hath my daughter show’d me; And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.
264	2	2	KING	HAMLET	But how hath she receiv’d his love?
265	2	2	POLONIUS	KING	What do you think of me?
266	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	As of a man faithful and honourable.
267	2	2	POLONIUS	KING	I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing, As I perceiv’d it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me, what might you, Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think, If I had play’d the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look’d upon this love with idle sight, What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: ‘Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. This must not be.’ And then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice, And he, repulsed,—a short tale to make— Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we wail for.
268	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	Do you think ’tis this?
269	2	2	QUEEN	KING	It may be, very likely.
270	2	2	POLONIUS	QUEEN	Hath there been such a time, I’d fain know that, That I have positively said ‘’Tis so,’ When it prov’d otherwise?
271	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	Not that I know.
272	2	2	POLONIUS	KING	Take this from this, if this be otherwise. [_Points to his head and shoulder._] If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.
273	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	How may we try it further?
274	2	2	POLONIUS	KING	You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.
275	2	2	QUEEN	POLONIUS	So he does indeed.
276	2	2	POLONIUS	QUEEN	At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him. Be you and I behind an arras then, Mark the encounter. If he love her not, And be not from his reason fall’n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters.
277	2	2	KING	POLONIUS	We will try it. Enter Hamlet, reading.
278	2	2	QUEEN	KING	But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
279	2	2	POLONIUS	QUEEN	Away, I do beseech you, both away I’ll board him presently. O, give me leave. How does my good Lord Hamlet?
280	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Well, God-a-mercy.
281	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Do you know me, my lord?
282	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Excellent well. You’re a fishmonger.
283	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Not I, my lord.
284	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Then I would you were so honest a man.
285	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Honest, my lord?
286	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
287	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	That’s very true, my lord.
288	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion,— Have you a daughter?
289	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	I have, my lord.
290	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to’t.
291	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again.—What do you read, my lord?
292	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Words, words, words.
293	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	What is the matter, my lord?
294	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Between who?
295	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
296	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down. For you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.
297	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Though this be madness, yet there is a method in’t.— Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
298	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Into my grave?
299	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Indeed, that is out o’ the air. How pregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
300	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my life.
301	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Fare you well, my lord.
302	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	These tedious old fools. Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
303	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
304	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	POLONIUS	God save you, sir.
305	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	ROSENCRANTZ	My honoured lord!
306	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	GUILDENSTERN	My most dear lord!
307	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?
308	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	As the indifferent children of the earth.
309	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	ROSENCRANTZ	Happy in that we are not over-happy; On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.
310	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Nor the soles of her shoe?
311	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Neither, my lord.
312	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?
313	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Faith, her privates we.
314	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the news?
315	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.
316	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?
317	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Prison, my lord?
318	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Denmark’s a prison.
319	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Then is the world one.
320	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst.
321	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	We think not so, my lord.
322	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
323	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Why, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.
324	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
325	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
326	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	A dream itself is but a shadow.
327	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
328	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot reason. ROSENCRANTZ and
329	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	We’ll wait upon you.
330	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
331	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.
332	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.
333	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	What should we say, my lord?
334	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.
335	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	To what end, my lord?
336	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no.
337	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	What say you?
338	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.
339	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	My lord, we were sent for.
340	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason? How infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? In action how like an angel? In apprehension, how like a god? The beauty of the world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
341	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
342	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?
343	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
344	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	He that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’ sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?
345	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Even those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the city.
346	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
347	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
348	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
349	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	No, indeed, they are not.
350	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
351	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an ayry of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
352	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?
353	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
354	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Is’t possible?
355	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
356	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Do the boys carry it away?
357	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.
358	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
359	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	There are the players.
360	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
361	2	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	In what, my dear lord?
362	2	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw. Enter Polonius.
363	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Well be with you, gentlemen.
364	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
365	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.
366	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.—You say right, sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.
367	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you.
368	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—
369	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	The actors are come hither, my lord.
370	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Buzz, buzz.
371	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Upon my honour.
372	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Then came each actor on his ass—
373	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the law of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.
374	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
375	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	What treasure had he, my lord?
376	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Why— ’One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved passing well.’
377	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Still on my daughter.
378	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?
379	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
380	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Nay, that follows not.
381	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	What follows then, my lord?
382	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass, as most like it was. The first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where my abridgement comes. Enter four or five Players. You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
383	2	2	FIRST PLAYER	HAMLET	What speech, my lord?
384	2	2	HAMLET	FIRST PLAYER	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, ’twas caviare to the general. But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see: _The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast,—_ It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus— _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and a damned light To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o’ersized with coagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks._ So, proceed you.
385	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.
386	2	2	FIRST PLAYER	POLONIUS	_Anon he finds him, Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command. Unequal match’d, Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword Th’unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ th’air to stick. So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing. But as we often see against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus’ pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work, And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall On Mars’s armour, forg’d for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods, In general synod, take away her power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends._
387	2	2	POLONIUS	FIRST PLAYER	This is too long.
388	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prythee say on. He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.
389	2	2	FIRST PLAYER	HAMLET	_But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,—_
390	2	2	HAMLET	FIRST PLAYER	‘The mobled queen’?
391	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	That’s good! ‘Mobled queen’ is good.
392	2	2	FIRST PLAYER	POLONIUS	_Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames With bisson rheum. A clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, About her lank and all o’erteemed loins, A blanket, in th’alarm of fear caught up— Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d, ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d. But if the gods themselves did see her then, When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she made,— Unless things mortal move them not at all,— Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, And passion in the gods._
393	2	2	POLONIUS	FIRST PLAYER	Look, where he has not turn’d his colour, and has tears in’s eyes. Pray you, no more.
394	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.—Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
395	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
396	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	God’s bodikin, man, better. Use every man after his desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.
397	2	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Come, sirs.
398	2	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow. Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?
399	2	2	FIRST PLAYER	HAMLET	Ay, my lord.
400	2	2	HAMLET	FIRST PLAYER	We’ll ha’t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could you not?
401	2	2	FIRST PLAYER	HAMLET	Ay, my lord.
402	2	2	HAMLET	FIRST PLAYER	Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not. My good friends, I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.
403	2	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Good my lord.
404	2	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, so, God b’ wi’ ye. Now I am alone. O what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wan’d; Tears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba? What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty, and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed, The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing. No, not for a king Upon whose property and most dear life A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i’ th’ throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this? Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! Oh vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder’d, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon’t! Foh! About, my brain! I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene, Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim’d their malefactions. For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks; I’ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil, and the devil hath power T’assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds More relative than this. The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.
405	3	1	KING	ROSENCRANTZ	And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
406	3	1	ROSENCRANTZ	KING	He does confess he feels himself distracted, But from what cause he will by no means speak.
407	3	1	GUILDENSTERN	ROSENCRANTZ	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state.
408	3	1	QUEEN	GUILDENSTERN	Did he receive you well?
409	3	1	ROSENCRANTZ	QUEEN	Most like a gentleman.
410	3	1	GUILDENSTERN	ROSENCRANTZ	But with much forcing of his disposition.
411	3	1	ROSENCRANTZ	GUILDENSTERN	Niggard of question, but of our demands, Most free in his reply.
412	3	1	QUEEN	ROSENCRANTZ	Did you assay him to any pastime?
413	3	1	ROSENCRANTZ	QUEEN	Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o’er-raught on the way. Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it. They are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.
414	3	1	POLONIUS	ROSENCRANTZ	’Tis most true; And he beseech’d me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.
415	3	1	KING	POLONIUS	With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin’d. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights.
416	3	1	ROSENCRANTZ	KING	We shall, my lord.
417	3	1	KING	ROSENCRANTZ	Sweet Gertrude, leave us too, For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as ’twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia. Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather by him, as he is behav’d, If’t be th’affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for.
418	3	1	QUEEN	KING	I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet’s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours.
419	3	1	OPHELIA	QUEEN	Madam, I wish it may.
420	3	1	POLONIUS	OPHELIA	Ophelia, walk you here.—Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.— Read on this book, That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness.—We are oft to blame in this, ’Tis too much prov’d, that with devotion’s visage And pious action we do sugar o’er The devil himself.
421	3	1	KING	POLONIUS	O ’tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word. O heavy burden!
422	3	1	POLONIUS	KING	I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord. Enter Hamlet.
423	3	1	HAMLET	POLONIUS	To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die—to sleep, No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to: ’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The pangs of dispriz’d love, the law’s delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment, With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. Soft you now, The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember’d.
424	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?
425	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
426	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to re-deliver. I pray you, now receive them.
427	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	No, not I. I never gave you aught.
428	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	My honour’d lord, you know right well you did, And with them words of so sweet breath compos’d As made the things more rich; their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord.
429	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Ha, ha! Are you honest?
430	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	My lord?
431	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Are you fair?
432	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	What means your lordship?
433	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
434	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
435	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
436	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
437	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.
438	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	I was the more deceived.
439	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?
440	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	At home, my lord.
441	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own house. Farewell.
442	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	O help him, you sweet heavens!
443	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.
444	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	O heavenly powers, restore him!
445	3	1	HAMLET	OPHELIA	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on’t, it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.
446	3	1	OPHELIA	HAMLET	O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown! The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword, Th’expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, Th’observ’d of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck’d the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh, That unmatch’d form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy. O woe is me, T’have seen what I have seen, see what I see. Enter King and Polonius.
447	3	1	KING	OPHELIA	Love? His affections do not that way tend, Nor what he spake, though it lack’d form a little, Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul O’er which his melancholy sits on brood, And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger, which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute: Haply the seas and countries different, With variable objects, shall expel This something settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on’t?
448	3	1	POLONIUS	KING	It shall do well. But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia? You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said, We heard it all. My lord, do as you please, But if you hold it fit, after the play, Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief, let her be round with him, And I’ll be plac’d, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him; or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.
449	3	1	KING	POLONIUS	It shall be so. Madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go.
450	3	2	HAMLET	FIRST PLAYER	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
451	3	2	FIRST PLAYER	HAMLET	I warrant your honour.
452	3	2	HAMLET	FIRST PLAYER	Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
453	3	2	FIRST PLAYER	HAMLET	I hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.
454	3	2	HAMLET	FIRST PLAYER	O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That’s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready. Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
455	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	And the Queen too, and that presently.
456	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Bid the players make haste. Will you two help to hasten them? ROSENCRANTZ and
457	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	We will, my lord.
458	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	What ho, Horatio! Enter Horatio.
459	3	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Here, sweet lord, at your service.
460	3	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man As e’er my conversation cop’d withal.
461	3	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	O my dear lord.
462	3	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee, That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter’d? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice, And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal’d thee for herself. For thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta’en with equal thanks. And bles’d are those Whose blood and judgment are so well co-mingled That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee. Something too much of this. There is a play tonight before the King. One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee, of my father’s death. I prythee, when thou see’st that act a-foot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle. If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen; And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face; And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming.
463	3	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Well, my lord. If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
464	3	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	They are coming to the play. I must be idle. Get you a place. Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and others.
465	3	2	KING	HAMLET	How fares our cousin Hamlet?
466	3	2	HAMLET	KING	Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
467	3	2	KING	HAMLET	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.
468	3	2	HAMLET	KING	No, nor mine now. My lord, you play’d once i’ th’university, you say?
469	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
470	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	What did you enact?
471	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	I did enact Julius Caesar. I was kill’d i’ th’ Capitol. Brutus killed me.
472	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?
473	3	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
474	3	2	QUEEN	ROSENCRANTZ	Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
475	3	2	HAMLET	QUEEN	No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.
476	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	O ho! do you mark that?
477	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
478	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	No, my lord.
479	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	I mean, my head upon your lap?
480	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Ay, my lord.
481	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Do you think I meant country matters?
482	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	I think nothing, my lord.
483	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.
484	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	What is, my lord?
485	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Nothing.
486	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	You are merry, my lord.
487	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Who, I?
488	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Ay, my lord.
489	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within’s two hours.
490	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.
491	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year. But by’r lady, he must build churches then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is ‘For, O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!’ Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters. _Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King’s ears, and exits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love._
492	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	What means this, my lord?
493	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Marry, this is miching mallicho; it means mischief.
494	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Belike this show imports the argument of the play. Enter Prologue.
495	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.
496	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Will they tell us what this show meant?
497	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	Ay, or any show that you’ll show him. Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.
498	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	You are naught, you are naught: I’ll mark the play.
499	3	2	PROLOGUE	OPHELIA	_For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently._
500	3	2	HAMLET	PROLOGUE	Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
501	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	’Tis brief, my lord.
502	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	As woman’s love. Enter a King and a Queen.
503	3	2	PLAYER KING	HAMLET	Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrow’d sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
504	3	2	PLAYER QUEEN	PLAYER KING	So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o’er ere love be done. But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: For women’s fear and love holds quantity, In neither aught, or in extremity. Now what my love is, proof hath made you know, And as my love is siz’d, my fear is so. Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
505	3	2	PLAYER KING	PLAYER QUEEN	Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too: My operant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, Honour’d, belov’d, and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou—
506	3	2	PLAYER QUEEN	PLAYER KING	O confound the rest. Such love must needs be treason in my breast. In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second but who kill’d the first.
507	3	2	HAMLET	PLAYER QUEEN	Wormwood, wormwood.
508	3	2	PLAYER QUEEN	HAMLET	The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love. A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed.
509	3	2	PLAYER KING	PLAYER QUEEN	I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine, oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity: Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree, But fall unshaken when they mellow be. Most necessary ’tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt. What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy. Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye; nor ’tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change, For ’tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies, The poor advanc’d makes friends of enemies; And hitherto doth love on fortune tend: For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown. Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own. So think thou wilt no second husband wed, But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
510	3	2	PLAYER QUEEN	PLAYER KING	Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light, Sport and repose lock from me day and night, To desperation turn my trust and hope, An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope, Each opposite that blanks the face of joy, Meet what I would have well, and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife.
511	3	2	HAMLET	PLAYER QUEEN	If she should break it now.
512	3	2	PLAYER KING	HAMLET	’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile. My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep.
513	3	2	PLAYER QUEEN	PLAYER KING	Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain.
514	3	2	HAMLET	PLAYER QUEEN	Madam, how like you this play?
515	3	2	QUEEN	HAMLET	The lady protests too much, methinks.
516	3	2	HAMLET	QUEEN	O, but she’ll keep her word.
517	3	2	KING	HAMLET	Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in’t?
518	3	2	HAMLET	KING	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ th’ world.
519	3	2	KING	HAMLET	What do you call the play?
520	3	2	HAMLET	KING	_The Mousetrap._ Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke’s name, his wife Baptista: you shall see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of work: but what o’ that? Your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the gall’d jade wince; our withers are unwrung. Enter Lucianus. This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
521	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	You are a good chorus, my lord.
522	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.
523	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
524	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
525	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	Still better, and worse.
526	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	So you mistake your husbands.—Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.
527	3	2	LUCIANUS	HAMLET	Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing, Confederate season, else no creature seeing; Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property On wholesome life usurp immediately.
528	3	2	HAMLET	LUCIANUS	He poisons him i’ th’garden for’s estate. His name’s Gonzago. The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.
529	3	2	OPHELIA	HAMLET	The King rises.
530	3	2	HAMLET	OPHELIA	What, frighted with false fire?
531	3	2	QUEEN	HAMLET	How fares my lord?
532	3	2	POLONIUS	QUEEN	Give o’er the play.
533	3	2	KING	POLONIUS	Give me some light. Away. All. Lights, lights, lights.
534	3	2	HAMLET	KING	Why, let the strucken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For some must watch, while some must sleep, So runs the world away. Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me; with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
535	3	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Half a share.
536	3	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself, and now reigns here A very, very—pajock.
537	3	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	You might have rhymed.
538	3	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?
539	3	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Very well, my lord.
540	3	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Upon the talk of the poisoning?
541	3	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	I did very well note him.
542	3	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Ah, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders. For if the king like not the comedy, Why then, belike he likes it not, perdie. Come, some music. Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
543	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
544	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Sir, a whole history.
545	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	The King, sir—
546	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Ay, sir, what of him?
547	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
548	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	With drink, sir?
549	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	No, my lord; rather with choler.
550	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.
551	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildly from my affair.
552	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	I am tame, sir, pronounce.
553	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	The Queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
554	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	You are welcome.
555	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.
556	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Sir, I cannot.
557	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	What, my lord?
558	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter. My mother, you say,—
559	3	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.
560	3	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?
561	3	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
562	3	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?
563	3	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	My lord, you once did love me.
564	3	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
565	3	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.
566	3	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Sir, I lack advancement.
567	3	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark?
568	3	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, sir, but while the grass grows—the proverb is something musty. Re-enter the Players with recorders. O, the recorders. Let me see one.—To withdraw with you, why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?
569	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
570	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
571	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	My lord, I cannot.
572	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	I pray you.
573	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Believe me, I cannot.
574	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	I do beseech you.
575	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	I know no touch of it, my lord.
576	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
577	3	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony. I have not the skill.
578	3	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me. Enter Polonius. God bless you, sir.
579	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
580	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?
581	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	By the mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
582	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Methinks it is like a weasel.
583	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	It is backed like a weasel.
584	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Or like a whale.
585	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	Very like a whale.
586	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Then will I come to my mother by and by.—They fool me to the top of my bent.—I will come by and by.
587	3	2	POLONIUS	HAMLET	I will say so.
588	3	2	HAMLET	POLONIUS	By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends. ’Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on. Soft now, to my mother. O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom: Let me be cruel, not unnatural. I will speak daggers to her, but use none; My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites. How in my words somever she be shent, To give them seals never, my soul, consent.
589	3	3	KING	GUILDENSTERN	I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you, I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you. The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies.
590	3	3	GUILDENSTERN	KING	We will ourselves provide. Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your Majesty.
591	3	3	ROSENCRANTZ	GUILDENSTERN	The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armour of the mind, To keep itself from ’noyance; but much more That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest The lives of many. The cease of majesty Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw What’s near it with it. It is a massy wheel Fix’d on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortis’d and adjoin’d; which when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.
592	3	3	KING	ROSENCRANTZ	Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed. ROSENCRANTZ and
593	3	3	GUILDENSTERN	KING	We will haste us. Enter Polonius.
594	3	3	POLONIUS	GUILDENSTERN	My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet. Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home, And as you said, and wisely was it said, ’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege, I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know.
595	3	3	KING	POLONIUS	Thanks, dear my lord. O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon’t,— A brother’s murder! Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence? And what’s in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up. My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder! That cannot be; since I am still possess’d Of those effects for which I did the murder,— My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen. May one be pardon’d and retain th’offence? In the corrupted currents of this world Offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? What rests? Try what repentance can. What can it not? Yet what can it, when one cannot repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, that struggling to be free, Art more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay: Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe. All may be well. Enter Hamlet.
596	3	3	HAMLET	KING	Now might I do it pat, now he is praying. And now I’ll do’t. And so he goes to heaven; And so am I reveng’d. That would be scann’d: A villain kills my father, and for that I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread, With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven? But in our circumstance and course of thought, ’Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng’d, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season’d for his passage? No. Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent: When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage, Or in th’incestuous pleasure of his bed, At gaming, swearing; or about some act That has no relish of salvation in’t, Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn’d and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays. This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. The King rises and advances.
597	3	3	KING	HAMLET	My words fly up, my thoughts remain below. Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
598	3	4	POLONIUS	HAMLET	He will come straight. Look you lay home to him, Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your Grace hath screen’d and stood between Much heat and him. I’ll silence me e’en here. Pray you be round with him.
599	3	4	HAMLET	POLONIUS	Mother, mother, mother.
600	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	I’ll warrant you, Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming. Enter Hamlet.
601	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Now, mother, what’s the matter?
602	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
603	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Mother, you have my father much offended.
604	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
605	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
606	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Why, how now, Hamlet?
607	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	What’s the matter now?
608	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Have you forgot me?
609	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	No, by the rood, not so. You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife, And, would it were not so. You are my mother.
610	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.
611	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge. You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you.
612	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho!
613	3	4	POLONIUS	QUEEN	What, ho! help, help, help!
614	3	4	HAMLET	POLONIUS	How now? A rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
615	3	4	POLONIUS	HAMLET	O, I am slain!
616	3	4	QUEEN	POLONIUS	O me, what hast thou done?
617	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Nay, I know not. is it the King?
618	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	O what a rash and bloody deed is this!
619	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king and marry with his brother.
620	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	As kill a king?
621	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Ay, lady, ’twas my word.— Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune, Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.— Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down, And let me wring your heart, for so I shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff; If damned custom have not braz’d it so, That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
622	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me?
623	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love, And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vows As false as dicers’ oaths. O such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul, and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face doth glow, Yea this solidity and compound mass, With tristful visage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act.
624	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Ay me, what act, That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
625	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Look here upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. See what a grace was seated on this brow, Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself, An eye like Mars, to threaten and command, A station like the herald Mercury New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill: A combination and a form indeed, Where every god did seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man. This was your husband. Look you now what follows. Here is your husband, like a mildew’d ear Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love; for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble, And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have, Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err Nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d But it reserv’d some quantity of choice To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn, And reason panders will.
626	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	O Hamlet, speak no more. Thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul, And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct.
627	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty.
628	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	O speak to me no more; These words like daggers enter in mine ears; No more, sweet Hamlet.
629	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	A murderer and a villain; A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord. A vice of kings, A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole And put it in his pocket!
630	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	No more.
631	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	A king of shreds and patches!— Enter Ghost. Save me and hover o’er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
632	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Alas, he’s mad.
633	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O say!
634	3	4	GHOST	HAMLET	Do not forget. This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But look, amazement on thy mother sits. O step between her and her fighting soul. Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works. Speak to her, Hamlet.
635	3	4	HAMLET	GHOST	How is it with you, lady?
636	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Alas, how is’t with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy, And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep, And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements, Start up and stand an end. O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
637	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares, His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones, Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me, Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects. Then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
638	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	To whom do you speak this?
639	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Do you see nothing there?
640	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
641	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Nor did you nothing hear?
642	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	No, nothing but ourselves.
643	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Why, look you there! look how it steals away! My father, in his habit as he liv’d! Look where he goes even now out at the portal.
644	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	This is the very coinage of your brain. This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.
645	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Ecstasy! My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music. It is not madness That I have utter’d. Bring me to the test, And I the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass, but my madness speaks. It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whilst rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven, Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds, To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
646	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
647	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	O throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good night. But go not to mine uncle’s bed. Assume a virtue, if you have it not. That monster custom, who all sense doth eat, Of habits evil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence. The next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And either curb the devil, or throw him out With wondrous potency. Once more, good night, And when you are desirous to be bles’d, I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord I do repent; but heaven hath pleas’d it so, To punish me with this, and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister. I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So again, good night. I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. One word more, good lady.
648	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	What shall I do?
649	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed, Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse, And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know, For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house’s top, Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep And break your own neck down.
650	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Be thou assur’d, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.
651	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	I must to England, you know that?
652	3	4	QUEEN	HAMLET	Alack, I had forgot. ’Tis so concluded on.
653	3	4	HAMLET	QUEEN	There’s letters seal’d: and my two schoolfellows, Whom I will trust as I will adders fang’d,— They bear the mandate, they must sweep my way And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For ’tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petard, and ’t shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set me packing. I’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room. Mother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor Is now most still, most secret, and most grave, Who was in life a foolish peating knave. Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good night, mother.
654	4	1	KING	QUEEN	There’s matter in these sighs. These profound heaves You must translate. ’tis fit we understand them. Where is your son?
655	4	1	QUEEN	KING	Bestow this place on us a little while. Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
656	4	1	KING	QUEEN	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
657	4	1	QUEEN	KING	Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries ‘A rat, a rat!’ And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man.
658	4	1	KING	QUEEN	O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there. His liberty is full of threats to all; To you yourself, to us, to everyone. Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer’d? It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain’d, and out of haunt This mad young man. But so much was our love We would not understand what was most fit, But like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
659	4	1	QUEEN	KING	To draw apart the body he hath kill’d, O’er whom his very madness, like some ore Among a mineral of metals base, Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
660	4	1	KING	QUEEN	O Gertrude, come away! The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed We must with all our majesty and skill Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern! Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him. Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this. Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends, And let them know both what we mean to do And what’s untimely done, so haply slander, Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank, Transports his poison’d shot, may miss our name, And hit the woundless air. O, come away! My soul is full of discord and dismay.
661	4	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Safely stowed. ROSENCRANTZ and
662	4	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
663	4	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come. Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
664	4	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
665	4	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.
666	4	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence, And bear it to the chapel.
667	4	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Do not believe it.
668	4	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Believe what?
669	4	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king?
670	4	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
671	4	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, sir; that soaks up the King’s countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
672	4	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	I understand you not, my lord.
673	4	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
674	4	2	ROSENCRANTZ	HAMLET	My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.
675	4	2	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a thing—
676	4	2	GUILDENSTERN	HAMLET	A thing, my lord!
677	4	2	HAMLET	GUILDENSTERN	Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
678	4	3	KING	ROSENCRANTZ	I have sent to seek him and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him: He’s lov’d of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; And where ’tis so, th’offender’s scourge is weigh’d, But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are reliev’d, Or not at all. Enter Rosencrantz. How now? What hath befall’n?
679	4	3	ROSENCRANTZ	KING	Where the dead body is bestow’d, my lord, We cannot get from him.
680	4	3	KING	ROSENCRANTZ	But where is he?
681	4	3	ROSENCRANTZ	KING	Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.
682	4	3	KING	ROSENCRANTZ	Bring him before us.
683	4	3	ROSENCRANTZ	KING	Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord. Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.
684	4	3	KING	ROSENCRANTZ	Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
685	4	3	HAMLET	KING	At supper.
686	4	3	KING	HAMLET	At supper? Where?
687	4	3	HAMLET	KING	Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service,—two dishes, but to one table. That’s the end.
688	4	3	KING	HAMLET	Alas, alas!
689	4	3	HAMLET	KING	A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
690	4	3	KING	HAMLET	What dost thou mean by this?
691	4	3	HAMLET	KING	Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.
692	4	3	KING	HAMLET	Where is Polonius?
693	4	3	HAMLET	KING	In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him i’ th’other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.
694	4	3	KING	HAMLET	Go seek him there.
695	4	3	HAMLET	KING	He will stay till you come.
696	4	3	KING	HAMLET	Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,— Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done,—must send thee hence With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready, and the wind at help, Th’associates tend, and everything is bent For England.
697	4	3	HAMLET	KING	For England?
698	4	3	KING	HAMLET	Ay, Hamlet.
699	4	3	HAMLET	KING	Good.
700	4	3	KING	HAMLET	So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.
701	4	3	HAMLET	KING	I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.
702	4	3	KING	HAMLET	Thy loving father, Hamlet.
703	4	3	HAMLET	KING	My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.
704	4	3	KING	HAMLET	Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard; Delay it not; I’ll have him hence tonight. Away, for everything is seal’d and done That else leans on th’affair. Pray you make haste. And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught,— As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process, which imports at full, By letters conjuring to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done, Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.
705	4	4	FORTINBRAS	CAPTAIN	Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king. Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promis’d march Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous. If that his Majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so.
706	4	4	CAPTAIN	FORTINBRAS	I will do’t, my lord.
707	4	4	FORTINBRAS	CAPTAIN	Go softly on. Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &c.
708	4	4	HAMLET	FORTINBRAS	Good sir, whose powers are these?
709	4	4	CAPTAIN	HAMLET	They are of Norway, sir.
710	4	4	HAMLET	CAPTAIN	How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?
711	4	4	CAPTAIN	HAMLET	Against some part of Poland.
712	4	4	HAMLET	CAPTAIN	Who commands them, sir?
713	4	4	CAPTAIN	HAMLET	The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
714	4	4	HAMLET	CAPTAIN	Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?
715	4	4	CAPTAIN	HAMLET	Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name. To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
716	4	4	HAMLET	CAPTAIN	Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
717	4	4	CAPTAIN	HAMLET	Yes, it is already garrison’d.
718	4	4	HAMLET	CAPTAIN	Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw! This is th’imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
719	4	4	CAPTAIN	HAMLET	God b’ wi’ you, sir.
720	4	4	ROSENCRANTZ	CAPTAIN	Will’t please you go, my lord?
721	4	4	HAMLET	ROSENCRANTZ	I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before. How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge. What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more. Sure he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unus’d. Now whether it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on th’event,— A thought which, quarter’d, hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward,—I do not know Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do, Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me, Witness this army of such mass and charge, Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff’d, Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death, and danger dare, Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then, That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep, while to my shame I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain? O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.
722	4	5	QUEEN	GENTLEMAN	I will not speak with her.
723	4	5	GENTLEMAN	QUEEN	She is importunate, indeed distract. Her mood will needs be pitied.
724	4	5	QUEEN	GENTLEMAN	What would she have?
725	4	5	GENTLEMAN	QUEEN	She speaks much of her father; says she hears There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart, Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts, Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. ’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
726	4	5	QUEEN	GENTLEMAN	Let her come in. To my sick soul, as sin’s true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss. So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt. Enter Ophelia.
727	4	5	OPHELIA	QUEEN	Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
728	4	5	QUEEN	OPHELIA	How now, Ophelia?
729	4	5	OPHELIA	QUEEN	How should I your true love know From another one? By his cockle bat and staff And his sandal shoon.
730	4	5	QUEEN	OPHELIA	Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
731	4	5	OPHELIA	QUEEN	Say you? Nay, pray you mark. He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone, At his head a grass green turf, At his heels a stone.
732	4	5	QUEEN	OPHELIA	Nay, but Ophelia—
733	4	5	OPHELIA	QUEEN	Pray you mark. White his shroud as the mountain snow. Enter King.
734	4	5	QUEEN	OPHELIA	Alas, look here, my lord!
735	4	5	OPHELIA	QUEEN	Larded all with sweet flowers; Which bewept to the grave did go With true-love showers.
736	4	5	KING	OPHELIA	How do you, pretty lady?
737	4	5	OPHELIA	KING	Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!
738	4	5	KING	OPHELIA	Conceit upon her father.
739	4	5	OPHELIA	KING	Pray you, let’s have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this: Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be your Valentine. Then up he rose and donn’d his clothes, And dupp’d the chamber door, Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more.
740	4	5	KING	OPHELIA	Pretty Ophelia!
741	4	5	OPHELIA	KING	Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t. By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie for shame! Young men will do’t if they come to’t; By Cock, they are to blame. Quoth she, before you tumbled me, You promis’d me to wed. So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun, An thou hadst not come to my bed.
742	4	5	KING	OPHELIA	How long hath she been thus?
743	4	5	OPHELIA	KING	I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but weep, to think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.
744	4	5	KING	OPHELIA	Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions. First, her father slain; Next, your son gone; and he most violent author Of his own just remove; the people muddied, Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers For good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts. Last, and as much containing as all these, Her brother is in secret come from France, Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father’s death, Wherein necessity, of matter beggar’d, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death.
745	4	5	QUEEN	KING	Alack, what noise is this?
746	4	5	KING	QUEEN	Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. Enter a Gentleman. What is the matter?
747	4	5	GENTLEMAN	KING	Save yourself, my lord. The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O’erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord, And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, The ratifiers and props of every word, They cry ‘Choose we! Laertes shall be king!’ Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds, ‘Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.’
748	4	5	QUEEN	GENTLEMAN	How cheerfully on the false trail they cry. O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.
749	4	5	KING	QUEEN	The doors are broke. Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.
750	4	5	LAERTES	KING	Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without. Danes. No, let’s come in.
751	4	5	LAERTES	KING	I pray you, give me leave.
752	4	5	DANES	LAERTES	We will, we will.
753	4	5	LAERTES	DANES	I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king, Give me my father.
754	4	5	QUEEN	LAERTES	Calmly, good Laertes.
755	4	5	LAERTES	QUEEN	That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard; Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother.
756	4	5	KING	LAERTES	What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?— Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person. There’s such divinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incens’d.—Let him go, Gertrude:— Speak, man.
757	4	5	LAERTES	KING	Where is my father?
758	4	5	KING	LAERTES	Dead.
759	4	5	QUEEN	KING	But not by him.
760	4	5	KING	QUEEN	Let him demand his fill.
761	4	5	LAERTES	KING	How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with. To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand, That both the worlds, I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I’ll be reveng’d Most throughly for my father.
762	4	5	KING	LAERTES	Who shall stay you?
763	4	5	LAERTES	KING	My will, not all the world. And for my means, I’ll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.
764	4	5	KING	LAERTES	Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?
765	4	5	LAERTES	KING	None but his enemies.
766	4	5	KING	LAERTES	Will you know them then?
767	4	5	LAERTES	KING	To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms; And, like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood.
768	4	5	KING	LAERTES	Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That I am guiltless of your father’s death, And am most sensibly in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgment ’pear As day does to your eye.
769	4	5	DANES	KING	Let her come in.
770	4	5	LAERTES	DANES	How now! What noise is that? Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers. O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye. By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits Should be as mortal as an old man’s life? Nature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves.
771	4	5	OPHELIA	LAERTES	They bore him barefac’d on the bier, Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny And on his grave rain’d many a tear.— Fare you well, my dove!
772	4	5	LAERTES	OPHELIA	Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus.
773	4	5	OPHELIA	LAERTES	You must sing ‘Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.’ O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter.
774	4	5	LAERTES	OPHELIA	This nothing’s more than matter.
775	4	5	OPHELIA	LAERTES	There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray love, remember. And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.
776	4	5	LAERTES	OPHELIA	A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
777	4	5	OPHELIA	LAERTES	There’s fennel for you, and columbines. There’s rue for you; and here’s some for me. We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O you must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither’d all when my father died. They say he made a good end. For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
778	4	5	LAERTES	OPHELIA	Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself She turns to favour and to prettiness.
779	4	5	OPHELIA	LAERTES	And will he not come again? And will he not come again? No, no, he is dead, Go to thy death-bed, He never will come again. His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll. He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan. God ha’ mercy on his soul. And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b’ wi’ ye.
780	4	5	LAERTES	OPHELIA	Do you see this, O God?
781	4	5	KING	LAERTES	Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right. Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will, And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me. If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch’d, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content.
782	4	5	LAERTES	KING	Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure burial,— No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones, No noble rite, nor formal ostentation,— Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth, That I must call’t in question.
783	4	5	KING	LAERTES	So you shall. And where th’offence is let the great axe fall. I pray you go with me.
784	4	6	HORATIO	SERVANT	What are they that would speak with me?
785	4	6	SERVANT	HORATIO	Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.
786	4	6	HORATIO	SERVANT	Let them come in. I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. Enter Sailors.
787	4	6	FIRST SAILOR	HORATIO	God bless you, sir.
788	4	6	HORATIO	FIRST SAILOR	Let him bless thee too.
789	4	6	FIRST SAILOR	HORATIO	He shall, sir, and’t please him. There’s a letter for you, sir. It comes from th’ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
790	4	6	HORATIO	FIRST SAILOR	‘Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. He that thou knowest thine,
791	4	6	HAMLET	HORATIO	’ Come, I will give you way for these your letters, And do’t the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them.
792	4	7	KING	LAERTES	Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursu’d my life.
793	4	7	LAERTES	KING	It well appears. But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr’d up.
794	4	7	KING	LAERTES	O, for two special reasons, Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d, But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,— My virtue or my plague, be it either which,— She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul, That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her. The other motive, Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender bear him, Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim’d them.
795	4	7	LAERTES	KING	And so have I a noble father lost, A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
796	4	7	KING	LAERTES	Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger, And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more. I lov’d your father, and we love ourself, And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine— Enter a Messenger. How now? What news?
797	4	7	MESSENGER	KING	Letters, my lord, from Hamlet. This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
798	4	7	KING	MESSENGER	From Hamlet! Who brought them?
799	4	7	MESSENGER	KING	Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not. They were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them Of him that brought them.
800	4	7	KING	MESSENGER	Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. ‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return.
801	4	7	HAMLET	KING	’ What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
802	4	7	LAERTES	HAMLET	Know you the hand?
803	4	7	KING	LAERTES	’Tis Hamlet’s character. ’Naked!’ And in a postscript here he says ‘alone.’ Can you advise me?
804	4	7	LAERTES	KING	I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come, It warms the very sickness in my heart That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, ‘Thus diest thou.’
805	4	7	KING	LAERTES	If it be so, Laertes,— As how should it be so? How otherwise?— Will you be rul’d by me?
806	4	7	LAERTES	KING	Ay, my lord; So you will not o’errule me to a peace.
807	4	7	KING	LAERTES	To thine own peace. If he be now return’d, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall; And for his death no wind shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident.
808	4	7	LAERTES	KING	My lord, I will be rul’d; The rather if you could devise it so That I might be the organ.
809	4	7	KING	LAERTES	It falls right. You have been talk’d of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.
810	4	7	LAERTES	KING	What part is that, my lord?
811	4	7	KING	LAERTES	A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy,— I’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French, And they can well on horseback, but this gallant Had witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d With the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought That I in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.
812	4	7	LAERTES	KING	A Norman was’t?
813	4	7	KING	LAERTES	A Norman.
814	4	7	LAERTES	KING	Upon my life, Lamond.
815	4	7	KING	LAERTES	The very same.
816	4	7	LAERTES	KING	I know him well. He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.
817	4	7	KING	LAERTES	He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence, And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o’er to play with him. Now, out of this,—
818	4	7	LAERTES	KING	What out of this, my lord?
819	4	7	KING	LAERTES	Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?
820	4	7	LAERTES	KING	Why ask you this?
821	4	7	KING	LAERTES	Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still, For goodness, growing to a pleurisy, Dies in his own too much. That we would do, We should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing. But to the quick o’ th’ulcer: Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake To show yourself your father’s son in deed, More than in words?
822	4	7	LAERTES	KING	To cut his throat i’ th’ church.
823	4	7	KING	LAERTES	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home: We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence, And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads. He, being remiss, Most generous, and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice, Requite him for your father.
824	4	7	LAERTES	KING	I will do’t. And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death This is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly, It may be death.
825	4	7	KING	LAERTES	Let’s further think of this, Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape. If this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance. ’Twere better not assay’d. Therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see. We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,— I ha’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry, As make your bouts more violent to that end, And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck, Our purpose may hold there. Enter Queen. How now, sweet Queen?
826	4	7	QUEEN	KING	One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.
827	4	7	LAERTES	QUEEN	Drown’d! O, where?
828	4	7	QUEEN	LAERTES	There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream. There with fantastic garlands did she make Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them. There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke, When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide, And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up, Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element. But long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death.
829	4	7	LAERTES	QUEEN	Alas, then she is drown’d?
830	4	7	QUEEN	LAERTES	Drown’d, drown’d.
831	4	7	LAERTES	QUEEN	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will. When these are gone, The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord, I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts it.
832	4	7	KING	LAERTES	Let’s follow, Gertrude; How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let’s follow.
833	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	Is she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?
834	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	I tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
835	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
836	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Why, ’tis found so.
837	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	It must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
838	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,—
839	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes,—mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
840	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	But is this law?
841	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	Ay, marry, is’t, crowner’s quest law.
842	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.
843	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	Why, there thou say’st. And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.
844	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Was he a gentleman?
845	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	He was the first that ever bore arms.
846	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Why, he had none.
847	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digg’d. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—
848	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Go to.
849	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
850	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
851	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	I like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To’t again, come.
852	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
853	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
854	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Marry, now I can tell.
855	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	To’t.
856	5	1	SECOND CLOWN	FIRST CLOWN	Mass, I cannot tell. Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.
857	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	SECOND CLOWN	Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say ‘a grave-maker’. The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor. In youth when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet; To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove, O methought there was nothing meet.
858	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?
859	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
860	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.
861	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	But age with his stealing steps Hath claw’d me in his clutch, And hath shipp’d me into the land, As if I had never been such.
862	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to th’ ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?
863	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	It might, my lord.
864	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	Or of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?’ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?
865	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	Ay, my lord.
866	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	Why, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with ’em? Mine ache to think on’t.
867	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	A pickaxe and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding-sheet; O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
868	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum. This fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
869	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	Not a jot more, my lord.
870	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
871	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
872	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sir?
873	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Mine, sir. O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.
874	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.
875	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore ’tis not yours. For my part, I do not lie in’t, yet it is mine.
876	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
877	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’t will away again from me to you.
878	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	What man dost thou dig it for?
879	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	For no man, sir.
880	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	What woman then?
881	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	For none neither.
882	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Who is to be buried in’t?
883	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.
884	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
885	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to’t that day that our last King Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.
886	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	How long is that since?
887	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into England.
888	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
889	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he do not, it’s no great matter there.
890	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Why?
891	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
892	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	How came he mad?
893	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Very strangely, they say.
894	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	How strangely?
895	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Faith, e’en with losing his wits.
896	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Upon what ground?
897	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
898	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	How long will a man lie i’ th’earth ere he rot?
899	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.
900	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Why he more than another?
901	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	Why, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out water a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.
902	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Whose was it?
903	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	A whoreson, mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?
904	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Nay, I know not.
905	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour’d a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester.
906	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	This?
907	5	1	FIRST CLOWN	HAMLET	E’en that.
908	5	1	HAMLET	FIRST CLOWN	Let me see. Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prythee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
909	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	What’s that, my lord?
910	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?
911	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	E’en so.
912	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	And smelt so? Pah!
913	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	E’en so, my lord.
914	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
915	5	1	HORATIO	HAMLET	’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
916	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. O, that that earth which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw. But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King. Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c. The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow? And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate. Couch we awhile and mark.
917	5	1	LAERTES	HAMLET	What ceremony else?
918	5	1	HAMLET	LAERTES	That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.
919	5	1	LAERTES	HAMLET	What ceremony else?
920	5	1	PRIEST	LAERTES	Her obsequies have been as far enlarg’d As we have warranties. Her death was doubtful; And but that great command o’ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers, Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her. Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.
921	5	1	LAERTES	PRIEST	Must there no more be done?
922	5	1	PRIEST	LAERTES	No more be done. We should profane the service of the dead To sing sage requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.
923	5	1	LAERTES	PRIEST	Lay her i’ th’earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest, A minist’ring angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.
924	5	1	HAMLET	LAERTES	What, the fair Ophelia?
925	5	1	QUEEN	HAMLET	Sweets to the sweet. Farewell. I hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid, And not have strew’d thy grave.
926	5	1	LAERTES	QUEEN	O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Depriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth a while, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms. [_Leaps into the grave._] Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.
927	5	1	HAMLET	LAERTES	What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane. [_Leaps into the grave._]
928	5	1	LAERTES	HAMLET	The devil take thy soul!
929	5	1	HAMLET	LAERTES	Thou pray’st not well. I prythee take thy fingers from my throat; For though I am not splenative and rash, Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!
930	5	1	KING	HAMLET	Pluck them asunder.
931	5	1	QUEEN	KING	Hamlet! Hamlet! All. Gentlemen!
932	5	1	HORATIO	QUEEN	Good my lord, be quiet.
933	5	1	HAMLET	HORATIO	Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
934	5	1	QUEEN	HAMLET	O my son, what theme?
935	5	1	HAMLET	QUEEN	I lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
936	5	1	KING	HAMLET	O, he is mad, Laertes.
937	5	1	QUEEN	KING	For love of God forbear him!
938	5	1	HAMLET	QUEEN	’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do: Woul’t weep? woul’t fight? woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself? Woul’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I. And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth, I’ll rant as well as thou.
939	5	1	QUEEN	HAMLET	This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclos’d, His silence will sit drooping.
940	5	1	HAMLET	QUEEN	Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I lov’d you ever. But it is no matter. Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
941	5	1	KING	HAMLET	I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech; We’ll put the matter to the present push.— Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. This grave shall have a living monument. An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then in patience our proceeding be.
942	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other; You do remember all the circumstance?
943	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Remember it, my lord!
944	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly, And prais’d be rashness for it,—let us know, Our indiscretion sometime serves us well, When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will.
945	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	That is most certain.
946	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark Grop’d I to find out them; had my desire, Finger’d their packet, and in fine, withdrew To mine own room again, making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio, Oh royal knavery! an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons, Importing Denmark’s health, and England’s too, With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off.
947	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Is’t possible?
948	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Here’s the commission, read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
949	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	I beseech you.
950	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Being thus benetted round with villanies,— Or I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play,—I sat me down, Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair: I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair, and labour’d much How to forget that learning; but, sir, now It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?
951	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Ay, good my lord.
952	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	An earnest conjuration from the King, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma ’tween their amities, And many such-like ‘as’es of great charge, That on the view and know of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow’d.
953	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	How was this seal’d?
954	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal: Folded the writ up in the form of the other, Subscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression; plac’d it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already.
955	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.
956	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Why, man, they did make love to this employment. They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow. ’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.
957	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Why, what a king is this!
958	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,— He that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother, Popp’d in between th’election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?
959	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.
960	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	It will be short. The interim is mine; And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’. But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours. But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a tow’ring passion.
961	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Peace, who comes here? Enter Osric.
962	5	2	OSRIC	HORATIO	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
963	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?
964	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	No, my good lord.
965	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
966	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.
967	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.
968	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.
969	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.
970	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
971	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
972	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,—
973	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	I beseech you, remember,—
974	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.
975	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.
976	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
977	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?
978	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Sir?
979	5	2	HORATIO	OSRIC	Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.
980	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
981	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Of Laertes?
982	5	2	HORATIO	OSRIC	His purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.
983	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Of him, sir.
984	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	I know you are not ignorant,—
985	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
986	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—
987	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
988	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them in his meed he’s unfellowed.
989	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	What’s his weapon?
990	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Rapier and dagger.
991	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	That’s two of his weapons. But well.
992	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.
993	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	What call you the carriages?
994	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.
995	5	2	OSRIC	HORATIO	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
996	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all imponed, as you call it?
997	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
998	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	How if I answer no?
999	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
1000	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
1001	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?
1002	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
1003	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	I commend my duty to your lordship.
1004	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	Yours, yours. He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s turn.
1005	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
1006	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out, Enter a Lord.
1007	5	2	LORD	HAMLET	My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.
1008	5	2	HAMLET	LORD	I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
1009	5	2	LORD	HAMLET	The King and Queen and all are coming down.
1010	5	2	HAMLET	LORD	In happy time.
1011	5	2	LORD	HAMLET	The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
1012	5	2	HAMLET	LORD	She well instructs me.
1013	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	You will lose this wager, my lord.
1014	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.
1015	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Nay, good my lord.
1016	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.
1017	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.
1018	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes? Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &c.
1019	5	2	KING	HAMLET	Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
1020	5	2	HAMLET	KING	Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong; But pardon’t as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, and you must needs have heard, How I am punish’d with sore distraction. What I have done That might your nature, honour, and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away, And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d; His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o’er the house And hurt my brother.
1021	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge. But in my terms of honour I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungor’d. But till that time I do receive your offer’d love like love, And will not wrong it.
1022	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	I embrace it freely, And will this brother’s wager frankly play.— Give us the foils; come on.
1023	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	Come, one for me.
1024	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.
1025	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	You mock me, sir.
1026	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	No, by this hand.
1027	5	2	KING	HAMLET	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?
1028	5	2	HAMLET	KING	Very well, my lord. Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.
1029	5	2	KING	HAMLET	I do not fear it. I have seen you both; But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.
1030	5	2	LAERTES	KING	This is too heavy. Let me see another.
1031	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
1032	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Ay, my good lord.
1033	5	2	KING	OSRIC	Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, ‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin. And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
1034	5	2	HAMLET	KING	Come on, sir.
1035	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	Come, my lord.
1036	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	One.
1037	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	No.
1038	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	Judgment.
1039	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	A hit, a very palpable hit.
1040	5	2	LAERTES	OSRIC	Well; again.
1041	5	2	KING	LAERTES	Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here’s to thy health. Give him the cup.
1042	5	2	HAMLET	KING	I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. Another hit; what say you?
1043	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	A touch, a touch, I do confess.
1044	5	2	KING	LAERTES	Our son shall win.
1045	5	2	QUEEN	KING	He’s fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows. The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
1046	5	2	HAMLET	QUEEN	Good madam.
1047	5	2	KING	HAMLET	Gertrude, do not drink.
1048	5	2	QUEEN	KING	I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
1049	5	2	KING	QUEEN	It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.
1050	5	2	HAMLET	KING	I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.
1051	5	2	QUEEN	HAMLET	Come, let me wipe thy face.
1052	5	2	LAERTES	QUEEN	My lord, I’ll hit him now.
1053	5	2	KING	LAERTES	I do not think’t.
1054	5	2	LAERTES	KING	And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.
1055	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally. I pray you pass with your best violence. I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
1056	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	Say you so? Come on.
1057	5	2	OSRIC	LAERTES	Nothing neither way.
1058	5	2	LAERTES	OSRIC	Have at you now. [_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes._]
1059	5	2	KING	LAERTES	Part them; they are incens’d.
1060	5	2	HAMLET	KING	Nay, come again!
1061	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Look to the Queen there, ho!
1062	5	2	HORATIO	OSRIC	They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
1063	5	2	OSRIC	HORATIO	How is’t, Laertes?
1064	5	2	LAERTES	OSRIC	Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric. I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.
1065	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	How does the Queen?
1066	5	2	KING	HAMLET	She swoons to see them bleed.
1067	5	2	QUEEN	KING	No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet! The drink, the drink! I am poison’d.
1068	5	2	HAMLET	QUEEN	O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d: Treachery! Seek it out.
1069	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain. No medicine in the world can do thee good. In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom’d. The foul practice Hath turn’d itself on me. Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d. I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.
1070	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	The point envenom’d too! Then, venom, to thy work. OSRIC and
1071	5	2	LORDS	HAMLET	Treason! treason!
1072	5	2	KING	LORDS	O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.
1073	5	2	HAMLET	KING	Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.
1074	5	2	LAERTES	HAMLET	He is justly serv’d. It is a poison temper’d by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet. Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me.
1075	5	2	HAMLET	LAERTES	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu. You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest,—O, I could tell you,— But let it be. Horatio, I am dead, Thou liv’st; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.
1076	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Never believe it. I am more an antique Roman than a Dane. Here’s yet some liquor left.
1077	5	2	HAMLET	HORATIO	As th’art a man, Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I’ll have’t. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me. If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story. What warlike noise is this?
1078	5	2	OSRIC	HAMLET	Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.
1079	5	2	HAMLET	OSRIC	O, I die, Horatio. The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England, But I do prophesy th’election lights On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice. So tell him, with the occurrents more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
1080	5	2	HORATIO	HAMLET	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Why does the drum come hither? Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.
1081	5	2	FORTINBRAS	HORATIO	Where is this sight?
1082	5	2	HORATIO	FORTINBRAS	What is it you would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
1083	5	2	FORTINBRAS	HORATIO	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?
1084	5	2	FIRST AMBASSADOR	FORTINBRAS	The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late. The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Where should we have our thanks?
1085	5	2	HORATIO	FIRST AMBASSADOR	Not from his mouth, Had it th’ability of life to thank you. He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England Are here arriv’d, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view, And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world How these things came about. So shall you hear Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forc’d cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall’n on the inventors’ heads. All this can I Truly deliver.
1086	5	2	FORTINBRAS	HORATIO	Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune. I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
1087	5	2	HORATIO	FORTINBRAS	Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more. But let this same be presently perform’d, Even while men’s minds are wild, lest more mischance On plots and errors happen.
1088	5	2	FORTINBRAS	HORATIO	Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage, For he was likely, had he been put on, To have prov’d most royally; and for his passage, The soldiers’ music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot. [_Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is shot off._]
